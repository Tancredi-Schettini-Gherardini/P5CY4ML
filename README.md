This is the repository for arXiv: 2311.xxxx, containing:
- Statistical analysis and machine learning applied to the dataset of Calabi-Yau four-folds as hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces.
- Statistical analysis and machine learning applied to the list of co-prime six-dimensional weight systems, partitioned according to reflexivity, IP, intradivisibility and Calabi-Yau property.
- A new approximation/lower-bound formula for Calabi-Yau's in weighted projective spaces.
